## Acknowledgments

* Moeda has inspiration from [Rascal](https://github.com/cristianoliveira/rascal/)
* The name 'moeda' came from my incredible lack of imagination to name things. When I created the repository and thought of a name, I used the first thing I saw in front of me, some coins ('moeda' in portuguese) on my desk.
